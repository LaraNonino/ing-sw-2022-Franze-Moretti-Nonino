 * The lobbies are created from LobbyManager-class when a player wants to enter in it.
 * LobbyManager-class keeps trak of the waiting-lobbies.
 * There are at most one lobby per type in the waiting-lobbies list of LobbyManager because they are created when a player
 * wants to join it and they are removed from the list when they ged filled.
 * If a player waiting for other player in the lobby disconnects, it must be removed from the lobby with
 * removeDisconnectedPlayer()-method. The lobby is given as parameter when a GameController is created so that it learns
 * about the informations contained in its three attributes: usersReadyToPlaySocket, usersPlayerManager
 * and playerManagerThreads
